## 🌊 About The Project

**OceanRoute Nav** represents the intersection of algorithmic complexity and interactive visualization. Designed for logistics managers and maritime enthusiasts, it solves the complex problem of finding optimal sea routes across a network of international ports.

Unlike standard navigation tools, this project is built **entirely from scratch** without the use of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). Every data structure—from the graph representing the ocean network to the priority queues driving the pathfinding—is custom-implemented, demonstrating a deep understanding of computer science fundamentals.

### 🎯 Core Objectives
*   **Optimization:** Balance cost vs. time for cargo delivery.
*   **Visualization:** Render real-time search algorithms on an interactive world map.
*   **Simulation:** Manage port congestion and docking schedules dynamically.

## 🚀 Key Features

| Feature | Tech | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **🧠 Intelligent Pathfinding** | `Dijkstra` | Calculates the absolute cheapest or fastest route with millisecond precision. |
| **🕸️ Global Network** | `Adjacency List` | Ports act as nodes connected by weighted edges representing sea routes. |
| **📅 Schedule Management** | `Linked Lists` | Handles complex multi-leg journeys (e.g., Karachi → Dubai → Athens). |
| **🚦 Traffic Control** | `FIFO Queue` | Simulates port congestion; ships wait in queue if docks are full. |
| **⚓ Dock Queue Visualization** | `Real-time` | Visual representation of waiting ships at each port with animated queue indicators and estimated wait times. |
| **🎨 Interactive UI** | `SFML` | Beautiful, hardware-accelerated 2D visualization with hover effects and animations. |
| **🔍 Custom Filters** | `Sub-graphing` | Filter routes by specific shipping companies (e.g., Maersk) or avoid specific ports. |

## 📂 Configuration

Modify `ports.txt` or `Routes.txt` to expand the world:
*   `Routes.txt`: `Origin Destination Date Time Cost Company`
*   `ports.txt`: `PortName X_Coord Y_Coord Daily_Fee`

### ⚓ Dock Queue Visualization

The application now features real-time visualization of port congestion:

*   **Queue Indicators**: Ports with waiting ships display a dashed yellow line extending from the port, with animated ship icons moving toward the port.
*   **Queue Labels**: When ships are waiting, a label shows `Q:X | Yh` where X is the number of ships in queue and Y is the estimated wait time in hours.
*   **Default Configuration**: Each port has 2 docking slots by default. Queue and wait times are calculated automatically based on current traffic.
*   **Demo Data**: Singapore is pre-seeded with a demo queue (2 waiting ships, ~8 hour wait) to showcase the visualization feature.

**Note**: The ports.txt file format remains unchanged. Queue management is handled dynamically at runtime without requiring schema modifications.

### 🚢 Real-Time Docking and Layover Simulation

The application features a complete real-time simulation system that brings maritime logistics to life:

**Simulation Clock**
*   **Scaled Time**: Real-time clock that advances continuously while the application runs (default 60x speed = 1 day in ~24 real minutes)
*   **Speed Control**: Adjustable speed settings (1x, 10x, 60x, 120x) via the "Speed" button in the sidebar
*   **Play/Pause**: Control simulation flow with the Play/Pause button
*   **Time Display**: Current simulation date/time shown in DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM format

**Ship Simulation**
*   **State Machine**: Ships transition through realistic states:
  - **Waiting Queue**: Ships wait at origin port until departure time, or at intermediate ports until next leg
  - **Traveling**: Ships move along route legs, visually displayed as orange circles moving between ports
  - **Completed**: Ships that reach their final destination are removed from simulation
*   **Visual Indicators**:
  - **Orange Circles**: Ships currently traveling along routes (size: 5px)
  - **Blue Circles**: Ships waiting at ports (size: 4px, positioned around port icon)
  - **Active Ship Counter**: Displays total number of ships currently in the simulation

**Booking Integration**
*   **Book All Routes**: The "Book All Routes" button spawns simulated ships for each route found
*   **Real-Time Tracking**: Watch your booked ships depart, travel, and arrive in real-time
*   **Dynamic Queues**: Port congestion updates live as ships arrive and depart

**Port Queue Management**
*   **Dock Slots**: Each port has 2 docking slots by default
*   **Smart Scheduling**: Ships depart only when their scheduled departure time arrives AND a dock slot is available
*   **Queue Processing**: Estimated wait times update dynamically based on queue length and dock availability
*   **Automatic Flow**: Ships automatically proceed to next leg when departure time is reached

**Controls**
*   Located in the "SIMULATION" section at the bottom of the sidebar
*   **Play/Pause Button**: Start/stop simulation time
*   **Speed Button**: Cycle through speed multipliers (1x → 10x → 60x → 120x → 1x)
*   **Reset Button**: Clear all active ships and reset simulation state

**Technical Details**
*   No STL dependencies (custom linked list for ship management)
*   Efficient tick-based processing (processes simulation every minute)
*   Fractional time accumulation for smooth speed transitions
*   Memory-safe cleanup on reset and application exit
